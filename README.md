# Dev-Store: The Bharat Developer’s Marketplace

### Vision
Dev-Store is a centralized, AI-powered platform for Indian developers to discover APIs, Datasets, and Open-Source Models. We are solving the fragmentation in the Indian developer ecosystem by providing a context-aware search engine that understands Hinglish and technical intent.

### Technical Moat (Our Competitive Edge)
- **AI Brain:** Custom-trained Hinglish-to-Code embedding model (Fine-tuned on NVIDIA B200).
- **Search Logic:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Amazon OpenSearch for sub-second semantic retrieval.
- **Architectural Synthesis:** Integration with Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5) to generate ready-to-use Python/JS boilerplate code based on developer intent.

### 👥 The Team
- **Mohd. Arsh (Team Leader/Member 1):** AI/ML Lead - Model Training (B200) & RAG Orchestration.
- **Raunak Sharma(Member 2):** Backend Architect - Data Harvester & AWS Infrastructure.
- **Vansh Rawat(Member 3):** Frontend Designer - UX & Architecture Visualization.
- **Aryan Khatri(Member 4):** Integration Specialist - API Logic & Cloud Deployment.
